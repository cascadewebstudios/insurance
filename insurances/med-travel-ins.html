                <h2>What is Travel Medical Insurance?</h2>
                <p>
                    Travel medical insurance is a specialized type of coverage that protects you from unexpected
                    healthcare expenses while traveling outside your home province or country. Whether you're a visitor
                    to Canada or a Canadian traveling abroad, your regular health insurance typically does not apply
                    once you cross borders. Travel medical insurance fills this gap by covering emergency medical costs
                    such as hospital stays, doctor visits, prescription medications, and even emergency medical
                    evacuation. It’s designed to ensure that you can access quality healthcare during your trip without
                    facing overwhelming out-of-pocket expenses.
                </p>

            <div class="importance-text">
                Medical treatment in Canada can be extremely expensive for non-residents, and the public healthcare
                system doesn't cover visitors. Without travel medical insurance, even minor illnesses can lead to
                significant financial strain. For seniors and individuals with pre-existing conditions, the risk is even
                higher. Travel medical insurance helps you avoid unexpected costs, ensures access to necessary care, and
                protects your savings from being drained by sudden emergencies or trip disruptions.

        <h2 class="coverage-heading">What does Medical Travel Insurance Cover?</h2>

        <ul class="coverage-list">
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Urgent Medical Treatment: This includes expenses for ambulance
                transportation, hospital admission, diagnostic tests, surgeries, and other emergency care you may need
                during your trip.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Medical Evacuation: If appropriate medical care is unavailable nearby,
                your policy covers the cost of transporting you to the nearest facility that can provide proper
                treatment. This may include air ambulance services when necessary.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Return of Remains: In the unfortunate event of death while traveling,
                the insurance covers the cost of transporting your remains back to your home country, easing the burden
                on your loved ones.</li>

        </ul>

        <ul class="coverage-list not-covered">
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Routine Medical Checkups: Most providers will not cover unmprompted
                routine visits. This does not include checkups that are done due to any upcoming medical issue. </li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Cosmetic Procedures: If the individual insured desires to undergo any
                cosmetic surgeries (rhinoplasty, facelift, liposuction, blepharoplasty, etc.), most insurance providers
                will not cover it.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Pre-Existing Conditions: Most policies only offer coverage for
                pre-existing conditions if the patient's situation is stable at the time of insurance application and if
                there are no new health issues at the time of departure. </li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Dangerous Activities: Multiple insurance policies exclude coverage for
                injuries that are obtained through activities like skydiving, bungee jumping, extreme
                sports, etc.. If you plan on engaging in such activities, ensure your insurance plan provides coverage.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, you can extend your coverage as long as you request the extension before your current policy
                    expires. Requesting one after expiration may require a reapplication.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, travelers can buy emergency medical isnurance after entering Canada. However, most policies
                    include a short waiting period before benefits begin, so it's best to confirm these details with the
                    provider.</p>

                <p>Some comprehensive travel insurance plans go beyond medical emergencies and include coverage for trip
