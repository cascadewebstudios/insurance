                <h2>What is Critical Illness Insurance?</h2>
                <p>
                    Critical illness insurance is a special type of coverage that pays you a lump-sum amount if you’re
                    diagnosed with a serious medical condition that’s covered under the policy—such as cancer, heart
                    attack, stroke, or certain other major illnesses. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and meets the
                    policy’s criteria, the money is paid directly to you, not to a hospital or clinic. This means you
                    can decide how to use it—whether it’s covering treatment costs not fully paid by health insurance,
                    paying your mortgage, replacing lost income while you recover, or even funding travel for
                    specialized care. By giving you quick access to a large amount of cash, it helps reduce the
                    financial stress that often comes with a sudden, life-changing illness, so you can focus on your
                    health and recovery instead of worrying about bills.

                Facing a major health setback often brings financial challenges beyond direct medical costs—lost income,
                transportation, childcare, or even just keeping up with regular bills. Critical illness insurance offers
                a practical safety net, alleviating such pressures so you can focus on healing and recovery rather than
                worrying about money

        <h2 class="coverage-heading">What Does Critical Illness Insurance Cover?</h2>

        <ul class="coverage-list">
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Medical Expenses: Your lump-sum payout can be used to cover any number
                of medical expenses associated with your critical illness. This includes items like
                hospitalization, treatment, prescriptions, or specialized therapies.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Non-Medical Expenses: The funds you recieve can also be used for
                non-medical purposes, in order to compensate for the money you are unable to make while ill. This
                includes daily living costs,
                loan or mortgage payments, childcare, travel for treatment, or any other need that arises.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Term Coverage: Depending on the terms of the specific insurance
                provider and type, you can recieve protection for a set number of years (e.g., 10 or 20
                years). Insurance claims are valid during the active term.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Permanent Coverage: Many providers also provide lifetime coverage.
                This means that claims can be made for as
                long as the policy is active. It is adviced to check the terms of your specific plan to determine how
                long your claims are valid.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="coverage-list not-covered">
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Self-Inflicted Injuries: If you suffer from any illness or injury that
                is intentionally caused by
                yourself, you cannot file any claims with the majority of current insurance providers.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Pre-Existing Conditions: You cannot file claims related to any
                illnesses diagnosed or treated before you activate your policy. It is best to check with your provider
                for any exclusions.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Drug or Alcohol Abuse: If you have any conditions that arise from
                substance misuse, they will
                generally be excluded. However, exceptions apply, so confirm the terms of your plan with your provider
            </li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Waiting Period Restrictions: Illness diagnosed during the initial
                waiting period after policy start will not be covered.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Unlisted Illnesses: Only illnesses explicitly named in your policy are
                eligible for payout. Be sure to list all existing conditions to guarantee neccessary coverage.</li>

            </button>

                    payments—usually a percentage of your income—if you cannot work due to illness or injury.</p>

                <p>Health insurance covers eligible medical expenses such as hospital stays or surgeries. Critical

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>First, notify your insurer as soon as you receive a diagnosis. Complete the claim form, gather
