                <h2>What is Disability Insurance?</h2>
                <p>
                    Disability insurance provides financial support if you are unable to work due to an injury or
                    illness that causes a disability. It helps cover a portion of your expenses and ensures you can meet
                    financial obligations even without your regular income.
                    This coverage is especially important for sole earners and self-employed individuals, as it protects
                    your family from significant financial hardship in case of an unfortunate accident or prolonged
                    disability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are different types of disability insurance. Short-Term Disability Insurance provides coverage
                    for a limited period, such
                    as a few weeks or months, often used while recovering from surgery or illness. Long-Term Disability
                    Insurance offers extended coverage that can last several
                    years or until retirement age, protecting against prolonged disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disability insurance can be offered as group coverage through your employer or as an individual
                    policy. Group plans usually provide benefits based on your basic salary and are available only while
                    employed.Individual policies offer more flexibility and continued protection but generally have
                    higher
                    premiums.
                </p>

                Disability insurance offers peace of mind by safeguarding your income if you become unable to work due
                to injury or illness. It helps maintain your family’s financial stability, allowing you to focus on
                recovery without added stress over lost income and ongoing expenses.

        <ul class="coverage-list">
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Common Causes of Disability: Coverage typically includes disabilities
                caused by chronic illnesses like cancer or diabetes, accidents (including workplace injuries), physical
                injuries, and musculoskeletal disorders from long-term poor posture.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Income Replacement: Most policies cover 60-70% of your income during
                disability, helping to maintain financial stability while you’re unable to work.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Rehabilitation Benefits: Some plans provide financial support for
                rehabilitation, helping you recover and return to work as soon as possible.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Partial Disability Coverage: If you can only work part-time or perform
                limited duties after an injury, certain policies offer benefits adjusted to your partial ability to
                work.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Coverage Duration: Short-term disability insurance covers periods
                typically ranging from six months to a couple of years, while long-term disability policies can provide
                benefits until retirement age.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Definition of Disability: Coverage depends on policy definitions—some
                cover inability to perform your own occupation, others cover inability to perform any work.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="coverage-list not-covered">
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Disabilities Not Meeting Policy Definitions: If your condition doesn’t
                match the policy’s specific definition of disability, claims may be denied.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Pre-Existing Conditions: Disabilities or illnesses diagnosed or
                treated before your policy start date are usually excluded.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Self-Inflicted Injuries or Substance Abuse: Injuries caused
                intentionally by yourself or conditions related to drug/alcohol abuse are typically not covered.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Waiting Periods: Disabilities arising during the policy’s initial
                waiting period (elimination period) are not covered.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Coverage Limits: Some policies may exclude coverage for partial
                disabilities or restrict benefits depending on the severity and nature of your disability.</li>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>You can hold both types of coverage as long as benefits don’t overlap. Private policies usually cover
                    gaps left by government programs, but you’ll need to disclose all benefits when applying.</p>
